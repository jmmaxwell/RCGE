RCGE: a simple CGE model in R
========================================================

I translated Shoven and Walley's (1984) CGE model into R and solved it as a minimization problem.The only difference in my model is that I've allowed the number of households to be specified to any number: in this example there are 4.

In order to demonstrate the model's potential use, I solve for the benchmark equilbrium. Next the scale parameter on the production function for good 1 is increased (phi1 in the equation below).

$$
  \begin{aligned}
  Q_1 &= \phi_1[\delta_1L_1^\frac{\sigma_1-1}{\sigma_1}
  + (1-\delta_1)K_1^\frac{\sigma_1-1}{\sigma_1}]^
  \frac{\sigma_1}{(\sigma_1-1)}
  \end{aligned}
$$

The model is once more solved and equivalent variation is estimated resulting in the following:


```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
EV = c(4.477258, 4.563746, 6.879769, 2.974647)
households = c(1:4)
dat = data.frame(EV,households)
library(ggplot2)
c <- ggplot(dat, aes(x = households, y = EV))
     c + geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = I("deepskyblue4"))
```

To run this for yourself open "CGE makefil.R" and follow the steps it lists.
